   definitions and constants for all Swiss Ephemeris source files,
   only required for compiling the libraries, not for the external
   interface of the libraries.

   The definitions are a subset of Astrodienst's ourdef.h content
   and must be kept compatible. Everything not used in SwissEph
   has been deleted.

   Does auto-detection of MSDOS (TURBO_C or MS_C),  HPUNIX, Linux.
   Must be extended for more portability; there should be a way
   to detect byte order and file system type.
